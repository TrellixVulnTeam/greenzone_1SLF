Decisions the cookiecutter backend option sqlalchemy has made for you

When creating a project and selecting the backend option of sqlalchemy, the cookiecutter makes the following assumptions:

    You are willing to use SQLite for persistent storage, although almost any SQL database could be used with SQLAlchemy.

    You are willing to use SQLAlchemy for a database access tool.

    You are willing to use Alembic for a database migrations tool.

    You are willing to use a console script for a data loading tool.

    You are willing to use URL dispatch to map URLs to code.

    You want to use zope.sqlalchemy, pyramid_tm, and the transaction packages to scope sessions to requests.
